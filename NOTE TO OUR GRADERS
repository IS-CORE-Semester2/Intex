Hey guys! So we noticed that AWS was having a hard time transferring our Authentication token as we navigated around the website. That seems to be caused by the issues that the US-East server was having yesterday and today, based on the fact that before that, we were able to navigate through different tabs as an Admin or Researcher without any issues. Also after those issues with the region started happening, we were able to sometimes navigate fine, and sometimes it would keep prompting us to login.
So, if you are using the AWS hosted website (intex.jacksonvdw.com) and it keeps prompting you for authentication even though you are already logged in, would you please download the Visual Studio version and run it through there? That works flawlessly with the authentication, just as the AWS version should (and sometimes does).
If you have any questions feel free to reach out to us on Teams!
